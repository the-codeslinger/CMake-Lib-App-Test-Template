# CMake-Lib-App-Test-Template
 
This is a CMake project template including a 
[static library](lib/CMakeLists.txt), an [application](app/CMakeLists.txt)
depending on the library, and a Googletest based 
[test application](test/CMakeLists.txt) testing the library.

The goal is to provide an easy-to-understand CMake project based on 
[CMake's target system](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/04-targets/index.html).
The more I learn about CMake, the more I may expand this template if the feature
can be applied in a general manner.
